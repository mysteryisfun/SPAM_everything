Of course. This is an exciting project that combines several cutting-edge technologies. Building it requires a clear plan because we need to connect a web frontend, a backend server, and multiple real-time services.

Here is a comprehensive, step-by-step plan to build your voice agent.

### **Project Blueprint: The "Know-It-All" Voice Agent**

Our goal is to create a web application where you can click a button and have a real-time, spoken conversation with an AI agent. This agent will have a special "memory" (our RAG tool) that allows it to answer specific questions about a document we provide.

### **The Plan**

We will build this project in four distinct parts:

#### **Part 1: The Foundation - The Backend Server**
* **Technology:** We'll use **Python** with the **FastAPI** framework and uv for the environment handling. FastAPI is excellent for this because it's fast and supports asynchronous operations, which are perfect for real-time communication.
* **Responsibilities:** This server will be the central hub of our application. It will:
    1.  Provide an API endpoint for our frontend to get a **LiveKit access token**.
    2.  Host and run the main logic for our AI agent.

#### **Part 2: The Agent's Brain - RAG with ChromaDB & LangChain**
* **Knowledge Store:** We will create a simple text document that will serve as our agent's specialized knowledge base.
* **Vector Database:** We'll use **ChromaDB** to store this knowledge in a way the AI can understand and search quickly. We'll write a script to "ingest" our document into ChromaDB.
* **Tooling:** We'll use **LangChain** to create a formal `Tool` for the agent. This tool will have a clear name (e.g., `knowledge_base_search`) and a description that tells the agent when to use it (e.g., "Use this to answer questions about the company's history"). This is how the agent knows to look in its special memory instead of just using its general knowledge.

#### **Part 3: The Agent's Senses - Integrating LiveKit and OpenAI**
This is the core of the real-time interaction. Our backend will run a headless **LiveKit Agent**.

* **The Agent's Ears (Input):**
    1.  When you speak on the frontend, your audio is streamed into a LiveKit room.
    2.  Our backend agent, connected to the same room, receives this audio stream.
    3.  It immediately forwards your raw audio to **OpenAI's Realtime API** over a WebSocket.

* **The Agent's Mouth (Output):**
    1.  OpenAI processes your speech, thinks, and decides if it needs to use the `knowledge_base_search` tool.
    2.  Once it has an answer, OpenAI generates a new audio stream of its voice.
    3.  This audio is streamed back to our backend agent.
    4.  Our agent then publishes this incoming audio from OpenAI into the LiveKit room for you to hear on the frontend.

#### **Part 4: The Interface - A Simple Frontend**
* **Technology:** We will create a single **HTML file** with vanilla JavaScript to keep it simple and clean.
* **Functionality:**
    1.  The page will have a single button, like **"Start Conversation"**.
    2.  When you click it, the JavaScript will call our backend to get a LiveKit token.
    3.  It will then use the **LiveKit JavaScript SDK** to connect to the audio room and start capturing your microphone.
    4.  The UI will provide simple visual feedback, showing states like "Connecting...", "Listening...", or "Agent Speaking".

This structured approach ensures we build and test each part of this complex system logically. We'll start with the brain and the backend, connect the senses, and finally build the face.

When you're ready to start coding, just give me the command, and we will begin with **Part 1: Setting up the Backend Server**.
